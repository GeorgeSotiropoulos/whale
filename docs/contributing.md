# Contributing

**Contributions are welcome!**

We're using github [projects](https://github.com/rsyi/metaframe/projects) to manage contributions. If you would like to work on something new, we ask that you adhere to two \[loosely enforced\] principles:

* Open an issue first, so we can add the project to github projects.
* Write a test!
