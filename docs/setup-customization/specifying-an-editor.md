# Specifying an editor

By default, if no `$EDITOR` variable is specified, we open all files in `vim`. If you'd like to use a different editor, simple edit your shell's rc file with:

```text
export EDITOR=<your_editor_name>
```

We, however, recommend using vim or nvim for an optimal metaframe experience. ;\)
